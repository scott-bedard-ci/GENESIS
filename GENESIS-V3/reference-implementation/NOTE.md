# Reference Implementation Files

These files are copied to `src/_reference/` during project setup (STEP-5).

They serve as the gold standard template for ALL components in the design system.

**DO NOT MODIFY THESE FILES** - They are the canonical reference implementation.

During bootstrap, these files will be copied using:
```bash
cp GENESIS-V3/reference-implementation/* src/_reference/
```

See COMPONENT-TEMPLATE.md for complete documentation on the required 7-file structure.
