# GENESIS-V3: Pigment-Genesis Design System Setup

## ðŸš€ Quick Start for Claude

**Copy and paste this prompt to Claude to begin:**

```
Initialize the project by looking in the GENESIS-V3 folder and starting with the README.md file as your initial prompt. If you need to make any adjustments to what is in the instructions, log the changes in a file called GENESIS-V3-CHANGES.md
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

GENESIS-V3 splits the setup into manageable files that Claude can read without token limit issues. Follow these files **in exact order**.

## ðŸ“š Setup Files (Read in Order)

1. **[INIT.md](./INIT.md)** - Start here! Project initialization and dependencies
2. **[STEP-1-CORE-CONFIG.md](./STEP-1-CORE-CONFIG.md)** - TypeScript, Tailwind, Jest, and build configs
3. **[STEP-2-VALIDATION-SCRIPTS.md](./STEP-2-VALIDATION-SCRIPTS.md)** - All validation and setup scripts
4. **[STEP-3-FIGMA-SCRIPTS.md](./STEP-3-FIGMA-SCRIPTS.md)** - Token extraction and rebrand scripts
5. **[STEP-4-INSTRUCTIONS.md](./STEP-4-INSTRUCTIONS.md)** - Claude instructions and documentation
6. **[STEP-5-SOURCE-FILES.md](./STEP-5-SOURCE-FILES.md)** - Types, utilities, and reference implementation
7. **[FINAL-VALIDATION.md](./FINAL-VALIDATION.md)** - Verify everything was created correctly

## âœ… Quality First

**Remember**: Take unlimited time to achieve perfection. Quality > Speed always.

## ðŸš¨ Critical Success Factors

- **ALL files must be created** - No skipping any step
- **Order matters** - Dependencies exist between steps
- **35 total files minimum** - Use final validation to verify
- **Phase 0 prerequisite** - Must have Figma tokens before starting

## ðŸ“‹ Quick Checklist

After completing all steps, you should have:
- [ ] 11 script files in `/scripts/`
- [ ] 11 configuration files in root (including .gitignore)
- [ ] 9 documentation files (including READMEs and GENESIS-V3 docs)
- [ ] 11+ source files in `/src/` (including reference files and index files)
- [ ] 2 Storybook configs
- [ ] **Total: 44+ files minimum**

Note: Additional files are created by setup scripts (e.g., ReferenceComponent.tsx, git hooks)
